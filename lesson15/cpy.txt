《Today I begin a new life》
Today I shed my old skin which hath, too long, suffered the bruises of failure and 
the wounds of mediority.
Today I am born anew and my birthplace is a vineyard where there is fruit for all.
Today I will pluck grapes of wisdom from the tallest and fullest vines in the vineyard,
for these were planted by the wisest of my profession who have come before me,generation 
upon generation.
Today I will savor the taste of grapes from these vines and verily I will swallow the 
seed of success buried in each and new life will sprout within me.
The career I have chosen is laden with opportunity yet it is fraught with heartbreak and 
despair and the bodies of those who have failed, were they piled one atop another, 
would cast a shadow down upon all the pyramids of the earth.
Yet I will not fail, as the others, 
for in my hands I now hold the charts which will guide through perilous waters to 
shores which only yesterday seemed but a dream.
